# AlgoTimer

A no-nonsense, full-screen countdown timer for hackathons, demos, and “we have 5 minutes left” moments. It looks good on a projector, remembers your time if you refresh (because humans are human), and now lets you set any duration with a tiny button at the top right corner that does big things.

## Features

- Set any duration: hours, minutes, seconds. No more hard-coded tyranny.
- Fullscreen mode: hit the button on the top right corner, feel the power.
- Progress ring: oddly satisfying circle that shrinks with time.
- Auto-persist: refresh the page and your timer keeps its cool.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## How to Use

- Click “Set Time” (top-right) to enter your custom duration.
- Hit “Start Countdown”.
- Panic (optional).
- “Stop” resets to your chosen time.

## Why this exists

vibecoded within minutes for the Algothon hackathon cuz pulling up microsoft stopwatch is lame

## Tech

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. Looks fancy, stays simple.
